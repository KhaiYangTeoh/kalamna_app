    The user can drag and drop words onto images.
    When the user drags the word to the corresponding image, it is accepted and displays a tick.
    Once all the word-image pairs have been matched the next assessement is shown.

    Shows line of text with a blank space, and two buttons with options for what to fill the space with.
    The user has to pick the correct word.
